# Tower-Defense

## General information

This program is a simple Tower defense -game that I did during a course "Basic Course in Programming Y2". This game was an individual project so I have done it alone.

## Requirements for using the program

This program should work with Python version 3.x. The program is confirmed to work with Python 3.5. You will also need a pygame-library. I have used pygame version 1.9.3 but the program could also work with older versions. Remember to check that the pygame-version that you use is compatible with your Python-version.

## How to start the program

The program should work with both Linux and Windows. In windows, you can start the program by opening a command window in the directory that contains the files of this program and typing "Main.py". In Linux the procedure is nearly the same but you should write in the command line "python3.x Main.py" where 3.x is your Python-version (in my case "python3.5 Main.py").
